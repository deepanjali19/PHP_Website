<h1>Importance of Text</h1>

<p id="para">

<b>Text</b> is one of the most powerful ways of conveying a message.</br>

It is the most efficient and direct way to explain what one wants.</br>

Text plays a significant role in the world of knowledge.</br>

In consideration with this website, I learned better ways to present text.</br>

Many factors contribute towards a well-presented text.</br>

Some of the factors are text font, style, size, color, etc.</br>

While making this website I kept in mind, the background and text color,</br>

as one should be able to read the text properly.</br>

All the above mentioned factors contribute equally for the best representation of text.</br>
