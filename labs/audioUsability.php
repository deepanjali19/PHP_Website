<p id="para">

</br></br>
Audio is one of the most powerful way for a website to connect to it's viewers.
</br>
It doesn't just catch the attention but is really important feature for people with hearing issues/aids.
</br>
It is a great way to provide instructions and information regarding the website.

</br>
It works as a perfect element for personalization and customization.
</br>
It enhances the engagement of the user to the website.

</br>
But if poorly designed or used inappropriately, it can detract from the experience and be annoying.
