The Ontario government 
tabled an optimistic budget Thursday that boosts health spending, </br>
offers major tuition relief for most 
low-income students and includes robust growth projections </br>
that will allow it to fulfil its promise of balanced books by 2017-18. </br>
The $133-billion spending plan, tabled Thursday, 
will, however, also make life more expensive for some Ontarians.</br>
Students were the big winners,
 with a pledge to overhaul the Ontario Tuition Grant </br>
 program to cover the average post-secondary tuition 
 for students from families that earn $50,000 a year or less.</br>
The government has also 
increased funding for health-care sectors identified as </br>
priorities during pre-budget consultations, 
including palliative care ($75 million),</br>
cancer care services ($130 million)
 and $333 million to "redesign and consolidate" </br>
services for children and youth with autism.</br>
